Hi! This is Christopher Wright, I am a Mathematics and Computer Science student, husband, and father to 3 beautiful girls. Hobbies include, hiking, camping, astrophotography, and hanging out with my family. I enjoy everything mathematics related and find coding to be a great way to explore the beauty of mathematics.
